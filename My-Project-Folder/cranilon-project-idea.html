<body>
<p>For the Individual Project, I would like to create a travel blog. Last semester I studied in Australia. During the semester, I was able to travel around Australia and visit other countries including New Zealand, Singapore, Thailand, and Bali. The content of the page will be completely from my friends and I's experiences. In addition, the images will all be from ones I have taken myself throughout my trip. </p>

<p>The main page will contain an overview of my trip and why I chose Australia. The following pages will be one about New Zealand, one about Bali and Singapore, one about Thailand. Each page will include where I went and my suggestions about visiting each place. </p>
